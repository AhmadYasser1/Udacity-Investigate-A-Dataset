# Udacity-Investigate-A-Dataset

For this project, I conducted the data analysis process that I learned from the Udacity Data Analysis Professional Track.
I was given several datasets, and I chose the "No-Show-Appointments" that is uploaded in this repository.

The libraries used are NumPy, Pandas, and MatplotLib.

The steps I followed for this project are as follows:-

# Step One - Get Organized
The report communicating my findings
Any Python code I wrote as part of my analysis process
The data set I used (which is not included in the repository)

# Step Two - Analyze the Data

Brainstorm some questions I could answer using the data set I chose, then start answering those questions.
Try and suggest questions that promote looking at relationships between multiple variables. I aimed to analyze at least one dependent variable and three independent variables in my investigation. I made sure to use NumPy and pandas where they are appropriate!

# Step Three - Share my Findings

Once I have finished analyzing the data, I created a report that shares the findings I found most interesting. I used Jupyter Notebook and wrote notes alongside the python code. I made sure that the report text is contained in Markdown cells to clearly distinguish my comments and findings from my code work. The HTML file is uploaded , so it can be acccessed easily.

Thanks for reading and enjoy the project!
